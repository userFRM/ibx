/// # Thread lifecycle

/// `connect()` spawns a single `ib-engine-hotloop` background thread.
/// The thread is **joined** on [`disconnect()`] and on [`Drop`].
/// Dropping an `EClient` without calling `disconnect()` first is safe:
/// the `Drop` impl sends `Shutdown` and joins the thread. That holds for a

/// `wrapper=self` is: the wrapper is visited on traversal and released on
/// clear, so the cyclic collector finds that cycle and the drop runs.
