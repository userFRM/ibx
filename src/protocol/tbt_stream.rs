//! A frame carries one subscription's id, one timestamp, and then records until
//! the bits run out. There is no marker between records and no length in front
//! of one: a record ends when the fields its kind has are read, and each field
//! ends itself — a variable-length integer by its continuation bit, a string by
//! its own length.
//!
//! A price is not sent. What is sent is how far it moved, in whole ticks of the
//! contract's own smallest increment, added to where the price already was.
//! That running price starts at zero when a subscription opens, so the first
//! record's move is the whole price rather than a small step — a decoder that
//! expects a small step rejects the first record of every subscription.
