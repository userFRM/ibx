//! Bridge module: shared state and events between the HotLoop and external callers.
//!
//! Architecture:
//! - `SharedState` composes four domain-specific containers:
//!   - `MarketDataState` — lock-free quotes (SeqLock), TBT, real-time bars, news ticks.
//!   - `OrderState` — fills, order updates, cancel rejects, what-if, order cache.
//!   - `ReferenceState` — historical data, contracts, scanners, news archives, market rules.
//!   - `PortfolioState` — account snapshot, position info, atomic positions.
//! - `Event` enum carries all events through a crossbeam channel for the `EClient` API.
//! - The HotLoop pushes to SharedState sub-containers directly.
//! - External callers read snapshots and poll events without blocking the hot loop.
