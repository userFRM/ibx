//! Calls that answer.
//!
//! The rest of this client follows the reference client's shape: a request
//! goes out under an id and the answer arrives later on a callback, which is
//! the right shape for a program with its own event loop. It is a poor shape
//! for asking one question. These ask, wait, and hand back the answer.
//!
//! They drive `process_msgs` themselves. That drains everything the session
//! has queued, and a question keeps what carries its own request id — but what
//! it does not keep is no longer thrown away. A session installs the record it
//! keeps, and everything a question does not want goes there, so a fill or a
//! tick arriving while a question runs still reaches
//! [`Client`](crate::api::Client)'s own view of it.
//!
//! A bare client with no record of its own has nowhere to put them, and there
//! a question does still consume what it does not keep. Where nothing may be
//! missed, take the events from the channel
//! [`connect_with_events`](super::EClient::connect_with_events) hands back,
//! which the engine fills whether anything is pumping or not.
