//! Staying connected, and what the caller gets to say about it.
//!
//! With no gateway in the way, keeping the session is this library's job rather
//! than a daemon's. That work is automatic and needs no configuration: a client
//! built with defaults recovers from a dropped connection, puts its
//! subscriptions back, and says so. Everything here is for the cases where the
//! default is not what a particular process wants.
//!
//! The shape follows what a drop actually is. A connection can fail for reasons
//! that repeat usefully and reasons that do not, so recovery is bounded by a
//! budget rather than run forever, and the budget resets once the session has
//! been healthy for a while — a connection that drops once an hour is not the
//! same as one failing ten times a minute, and only the second is worth giving
//! up on.
