## Connection

#### `__init__`

Bind the wrapper the callbacks are delivered to.  `EClient(wrapper)` lands here through the interpreter; a subclass with a constructor of its own calls `EClient.__init__(self, wrapper)`, as the reference sample does with `wrapper=self`. Bound once: a second, different wrapper is refused, since callbacks may already be on their way to the first.

```python
def __init__(wrapper)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `wrapper` | `Py<PyAny>` | Wrapper callback receiver for synchronous delivery. |

---

#### `connect`

Connect to IB and start the engine.  Live logins (``paper=False``) enter a second-factor approval window and **block** until the factor is approved (mobile push) or the deadline fires (``ib_key_timeout_secs``, default ~18 min). This is a human approval gate, not a hang. To bound or avoid it: use ``paper=True``, pass a smaller ``ib_key_timeout_secs``, or run ``connect()`` on a worker thread with your own timeout. Paper logins skip the gate entirely. Set ``RUST_LOG=info`` to see a log line when the wait begins.  ``code_provider`` answers that factor with a typed code instead: ``code_provider(factor, display_id, avth_url) -> str``, where ``factor`` is ``"ibkey"`` (return the code shown for ``display_id``) or ``"authenticator"`` (return the account's current code; ``display_id`` and ``avth_url`` are empty). An authenticator account has no push to fall back to and cannot log in without this. It is called once, on a thread of its own, and holds the GIL while it runs — return the code, don't block on input. It is asked once and the login carries whatever it returns; what the venue does with a wrong code has not been exercised from here.  Multiple ``EClient`` instances can run concurrently in one process; each owns its own state, sockets, and engine thread, and ``connect()`` does not serialize across instances. If you pin engines via ``core_id``, give each a distinct value.  `port` is taken and not applied. The session connects to the venue directly, so there is no local socket to name a port on.

```python
def connect(host, port=0, client_id=0, username="", password="", paper=True, core_id=None, ib_key_timeout_secs=None, ib_key_token_sub_type=None, code_provider=None, readonly=False, settings=None, session_file=None, *, clientId=None)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `host` | `str` | Server hostname. |
| `port` | `int` | Port number (unused — ibx connects directly). |
| `client_id` | `int` | Client ID (unused — single-client engine). |
| `username` | `str` | Account username. |
| `password` | `str` | Account password. |
| `paper` | `bool` | If `true`, connect to paper trading. If `false`, connect blocks on the live second-factor approval window (see method note). |
| `core_id` | `usize or None` | CPU core affinity for the hot loop thread. Use a distinct value per engine when running several in one process. |
| `ib_key_timeout_secs` | `int or None` | Live second-factor approval timeout in seconds (default ~18 min). Lower it to fail fast on unattended live logins; ignored for paper. |
| `ib_key_token_sub_type` | `str or None` | Fallback second-factor token sub-type (default `"2a"`), used only when the server states none for the session; ignored for paper. |
| `code_provider` | `Py<PyAny> or None` | Callable `(factor, display_id, avth_url) -> str` returning the second-factor code. `factor` is `"ibkey"` (the code shown for `display_id`) or `"authenticator"` (the account's current code). Required for authenticator accounts, which have no push to fall back to; ignored for paper. |
| `readonly` | `bool` |  |

---

#### `disconnect`

Disconnect from IB.

```python
def disconnect()
```

---

#### `is_connected`

Check if connected.

```python
def is_connected()
```

---

#### `conn_state`

Which of `DISCONNECTED`, `CONNECTING` and `CONNECTED` this client is in.  `CONNECTING` is the span of `connect`, as read from another thread: the connection is claimed at the top of that call and the session's state handed over at the bottom, and `is_connected` reads true for the whole of it. A session that ended without being closed is connecting again from the moment `connect` is called on it, though what it held stays in place until the logon answers.

```python
client.conn_state  # read-only attribute
```

---

#### `client_id`

The number this session connected under, as the caller gave it, and `None` when there is no session.

```python
client.client_id  # read-only attribute
```

---

#### `host`

The server this session connected to, and `None` when there is no session.  The one it knocked on, which is the one the caller named — the venue may then send it elsewhere, and the rest of that list is where. The reference client holds what its caller passed here too.

```python
client.host  # read-only attribute
```

---

#### `port`

`None`: there is no port. The reference client's is the one its gateway listens on for it. This session speaks to the venue's servers on the ports the venue names, one per connection, and none of them is a number the caller gave — `connect` takes one and does not apply it.

```python
client.port  # read-only attribute
```

---

#### `conn`

`None`: there is no socket to hold. The reference client keeps the one to its gateway here and shares it with its reader thread. This client's connections are opened, read and kept alive inside its engine, and a caller has no hand on any of them.

```python
client.conn  # read-only attribute
```

---

#### `asynchronous`

`False`: there is no asynchronous mode. The reference client sets this nowhere either; its sample program reads it in `connect_ack` to decide whether to start the exchange itself. Here `connect` returns with the session up and its engine running, and `connect_ack` is announced from inside it, so there is nothing left for a caller to start.

```python
client.asynchronous  # read-only attribute
```

---

#### `server_version`

The protocol level this client implements: 217, the reference client's `MIN_SERVER_VER_ADDITIONAL_ORDER_PARAMS_2`. `None` before a session, as the reference client answers before its greeting.  In the reference architecture this number is the API level of the process a program is talking to. That process was the vendor's gateway, which announced it and had every request gated on it; here it is this client, so the number is a statement about this client and not a reading off the venue, whose logon names no such level.  217 is the newest gate whose feature is carried here. Nothing above it is: attached orders (218), the configuration requests (219, 221), `hedgeMaxSize` (223) and `conditionsIncludeOvernight` (226) are absent. Below it, a program that believes the number is wrong about the following, and every one fails loudly on use rather than quietly:  * Order fields this protocol does not carry, refused by name on `error` under 321 when the order is placed: `optOutSmartRouting` (56), `smartComboRoutingParams` (57), the delta-neutral settling, clearing and open/close fields (58, 66), `scaleInitFillQty` (60), `scaleTable` (69), `orderMiscOptions` (70), `algoId` (71), `randomizePrice` (76), `modelCode` on an order (103), `dontUseAutoPriceForHedge` (141), `whatIfType` (217). * Requests and fields that do not exist here, an `AttributeError`: the four `verify*` calls (70), `cancelContractData` and `cancelHistoricalTicks` (215), `ContractDetails.ineligibilityReasonList` (186), `Execution.submitter` (198). * A withdrawal stating a manual time, an operator or who entered it (169, 192), and an execution filter stating `lastNDays` or `specificDates` (200): refused by name on `error`. * Callbacks nothing fires, said on the call that would produce them: `receiveFA` and `replaceFAEnd` (157) after `requestFA` and `replaceFA`, whose answer is not read back, and `orderBound` (144) after `reqAutoOpenOrders`. These are the one case that is quiet at run time: a program that waits on them waits, and only the doc says why.  Every other gate at or below 217 names a request, field or callback that is here and carried.

```python
def server_version()
```

---

#### `tws_connection_time`

When the venue says this session logged in, by its own clock and in its own spelling; `None` when there is no session.  The reference client answers the time its gateway stamped on its greeting. The venue stamps every message it sends with the time it sent it, the answer to the logon included, and this is that stamp — the clock `competing_session` reads the other session's logon off. Where the venue stamped none, `connect` holds this machine's clock instead and says so in the log.

```python
def tws_connection_time()
```

---

#### `set_connect_options`

`opts` is taken and not applied. The reference client carries these on its greeting to its gateway, which reads them; there is no gateway between this client and the venue to read them.

```python
def set_connect_options(opts)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `opts` | `str` | Connect options, as the reference client takes them. Not applied. |

---

#### `start_api`

Nothing to start, once there is a session. The reference client sends its client id here and its gateway begins the exchange on receiving it. Here the id is kept on the client and never sent — one session holds the account — and `connect` announces `connect_ack`, the accounts and the next order id itself before it returns. Before a session exists this is reported the way the reference client reports it: on `error`, under 504.

```python
def start_api()
```

---

#### `check_connected`

Raises when there is a session, as the reference client's does, with the message `connect` refuses a second call under. Nothing otherwise.

```python
def check_connected()
```

---

#### `reset`

Forget the session — which here is closing it. The reference client drops its hold on the socket and leaves the socket to its reader thread; a session here is an engine that stays logged in at the venue until it is stopped, so this is `disconnect`. Nothing to forget is fine.

```python
def reset()
```

---

#### `events_lost`

How many engine events this session's channel discarded.  The engine never waits on a reader — a session that stalled on one would stop carrying market data — so an event arriving at a full channel is dropped. A program that acted on every fill it saw needs to know the difference between that and every fill there was. Zero for a session whose reader kept up.

```python
def events_lost()
```

---

#### `poll`

Run the event loop. Deliver everything waiting, once, and return.  `run` owns the thread it is called on, which a program with an event loop of its own cannot give it: an asyncio framework has to drive the callbacks from its own loop, and a blocking loop leaves it nowhere to stand. This is one pass of the same dispatch.

```python
def poll()
```

---

#### `run`

Deliver callbacks until the session ends.  Blocks the calling thread. Everything a program receives arrives from here, so it runs on a thread of its own or is the last call a program makes. `poll` does one pass instead, for a program that owns its loop.

```python
def run()
```

---

#### `get_account_id`

Get the account ID.

```python
def get_account_id()
```

---

#### `competing_session`

Another session that already held this account when this one connected.  `None` when this session is alone. Otherwise where the other one connected from, when it logged in, and whether this session is held to reading only because the other has the account.  Worth asking before starting work: the venue permits one logon at a time and takes the account from the older session without saying which it dropped, so a second client reads as data that stops arriving.

```python
def competing_session()
```

---

#### `ccp_session_id`

Session ID surfaced to webapp REST clients as `x-ccp-session-id`.

```python
def ccp_session_id()
```

---

#### `misc_url`

Logical-name → host URL lookup from the MiscUrls block of the logon response (e.g. `region_dam`). `None` when the logon did not carry the key.

```python
def misc_url(key)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `key` | `str` | Account value key (e.g. `"NetLiquidation"`, `"BuyingPower"`). |

---

## Calls That Answer

#### `contract_details`

Everything the venue knows about the contracts matching a description.  Sends the lookup, waits for the venue to say it has finished, and hands back every match. A description matching nothing returns an empty list; a venue that refuses the lookup raises with the reason it gave. 

```python
def contract_details(contract)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `contract` | `Contract` | Contract specification (symbol, secType, exchange, currency, etc.). |

---

#### `corporate_actions`

A contract's corporate actions, asked for and waited on.  One dict per action, stating what the venue stated: its kind as the two-letter name the venue uses, the day it takes effect, its value, and the dates and dividend descriptions the kind carries. A field the kind does not carry is empty rather than invented.  `contract` must carry the venue's id for it. Days are `YYYYMMDD`.

```python
def corporate_actions(contract, start_date, end_date)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `contract` | `Contract` | Contract specification (symbol, secType, exchange, currency, etc.). |
| `start_date` | `str` |  |
| `end_date` | `str` |  |

---

#### `historical_data`

Bars for a contract over a period, handed back rather than delivered a bar at a time to a callback.  `ADJUSTED_LAST` is served here and by `reqHistoricalData` alike. The venue has no adjusted series to pass through: an adjusted one is built from the raw trades and the contract's actions, which means holding both before a bar is handed over. This call waits and hands the folded series back in one piece; `reqHistoricalData` holds the raw bars until the actions arrive and then delivers them folded, bar by bar on its callbacks. Both are asked for by the venue's id for the contract, which the actions need.

```python
def historical_data(contract, end_date_time, duration_str, bar_size_setting, what_to_show, use_rth=1)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `contract` | `Contract` | Contract specification (symbol, secType, exchange, currency, etc.). |
| `end_date_time` | `str` | End date/time in `"YYYYMMDD HH:MM:SS"` format, or empty for now. |
| `duration_str` | `str` | Duration string, e.g. `"1 D"`, `"1 W"`, `"1 M"`, `"1 Y"`. |
| `bar_size_setting` | `str` | Bar size: `"1 min"`, `"5 mins"`, `"1 hour"`, `"1 day"`, etc. |
| `what_to_show` | `str` | Data type: `"TRADES"`, `"MIDPOINT"`, `"BID"`, `"ASK"`, `"BID_ASK"`, etc. |
| `use_rth` | `int` | If `true`, only return data from Regular Trading Hours. |

---

#### `head_timestamp`

The earliest moment the venue holds data for a contract.

```python
def head_timestamp(contract, what_to_show="TRADES", use_rth=1)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `contract` | `Contract` | Contract specification (symbol, secType, exchange, currency, etc.). |
| `what_to_show` | `str` | Data type: `"TRADES"`, `"MIDPOINT"`, `"BID"`, `"ASK"`, `"BID_ASK"`, etc. |
| `use_rth` | `int` | If `true`, only return data from Regular Trading Hours. |

---

#### `matching_symbols`

Contracts whose symbol or name matches a pattern.

```python
def matching_symbols(pattern)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `pattern` | `str` | Symbol search pattern. |

---

#### `news_headlines`

The option chains an underlying has, answered rather than only sent.  The client this follows returns them. Sending the request and returning nothing left a program that assigned the result holding nothing, with no way to tell that from an underlying with no options at all. The headlines the venue holds for a contract.  Answers rather than reporting through the wrapper, because a program written against the reference client reads the return value.

```python
def news_headlines(con_id, provider_codes, start_date_time, end_date_time, total_results)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `con_id` | `int` | Contract ID. Unique per instrument. |
| `provider_codes` | `str` | Pipe-separated news provider codes. |
| `start_date_time` | `str` | Start date/time for tick query. |
| `end_date_time` | `str` | End date/time in `"YYYYMMDD HH:MM:SS"` format, or empty for now. |
| `total_results` | `int` | Maximum number of news results. |

---

#### `trading_schedule`

When a contract trades, over a stretch of days.  Each session is its opening, its close, and the day it belongs to; the time zone they are stated in comes with them.

```python
def trading_schedule(contract, end_date_time, duration_str, use_rth)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `contract` | `Contract` | Contract specification (symbol, secType, exchange, currency, etc.). |
| `end_date_time` | `str` | End date/time in `"YYYYMMDD HH:MM:SS"` format, or empty for now. |
| `duration_str` | `str` | Duration string, e.g. `"1 D"`, `"1 W"`, `"1 M"`, `"1 Y"`. |
| `use_rth` | `bool` | If `true`, only return data from Regular Trading Hours. |

---

#### `option_chains`

Every venue's option chain for an underlying, returned rather than delivered on a callback: expiries and strikes, per venue.

```python
def option_chains(underlying_symbol, fut_fop_exchange, underlying_sec_type, underlying_con_id)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `underlying_symbol` | `str` | Underlying symbol (e.g. `"AAPL"`). |
| `fut_fop_exchange` | `str` | Exchange for futures/FOP options. |
| `underlying_sec_type` | `str` | Underlying security type (e.g. `"STK"`). |
| `underlying_con_id` | `int` | Underlying contract ID. |

---

#### `histogram_data`

How a contract's traded volume is spread across prices over a period.

```python
def histogram_data(contract, use_rth=True, time_period="3 days")
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `contract` | `Contract` | Contract specification (symbol, secType, exchange, currency, etc.). |
| `use_rth` | `bool` | If `true`, only return data from Regular Trading Hours. |
| `time_period` | `str` | Histogram time period. |

---

#### `fundamental_data`

A fundamental report on a contract, as the venue supplies it.

```python
def fundamental_data(contract, report_type)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `contract` | `Contract` | Contract specification (symbol, secType, exchange, currency, etc.). |
| `report_type` | `str` | Report type: `"ReportSnapshot"`, `"ReportsFinSummary"`, `"RESC"`, etc. |

---

#### `qualify_contract`

```python
def qualify_contract(contract)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `contract` | `Contract` | Contract specification (symbol, secType, exchange, currency, etc.). |

---

#### `qualify_contracts`

Fill in a whole list of contracts, keeping their order.  One that cannot be resolved fails the call rather than being dropped: a list quietly shorter than it was asked for is how a program trades something other than what it named.

```python
def qualify_contracts(contracts)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `contracts` | `list` | Contract specification (symbol, secType, exchange, currency, etc.). |

---

## Account & Portfolio

#### `req_pnl`

Request P&L updates for the account.  `model_code` is taken and not applied. One session holds one account here, and the venue states its figures for that account without being asked which, so there is no second account or model portfolio to name.

```python
def req_pnl(req_id, account, model_code="")
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `req_id` | `int` | Request identifier. Used to match responses to requests. |
| `account` | `str` | Account ID. |
| `model_code` | `str` | Model portfolio code (empty for default). |

---

#### `cancel_pnl`

Cancel P&L subscription.

```python
def cancel_pnl(req_id)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `req_id` | `int` | Request identifier. Used to match responses to requests. |

---

#### `req_pnl_single`

Request P&L for a single position.  `account` and `model_code` are taken and not applied. One session holds one account here, and the venue states its figures for that account without being asked which, so there is no second account or model portfolio to name.

```python
def req_pnl_single(req_id, account, model_code, con_id)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `req_id` | `int` | Request identifier. Used to match responses to requests. |
| `account` | `str` | Account ID. |
| `model_code` | `str` | Model portfolio code (empty for default). |
| `con_id` | `int` | Contract ID. Unique per instrument. |

---

#### `cancel_pnl_single`

Cancel single-position P&L subscription.

```python
def cancel_pnl_single(req_id)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `req_id` | `int` | Request identifier. Used to match responses to requests. |

---

#### `req_account_summary`

Request account summary.  `group_name` is taken and not applied. One session holds one account here, and the venue states its figures for that account without being asked which, so there is no second account or model portfolio to name.

```python
def req_account_summary(req_id, group_name, tags)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `req_id` | `int` | Request identifier. Used to match responses to requests. |
| `group_name` | `str` | Account group name (e.g. `"All"`). |
| `tags` | `str` | Comma-separated account tags: `"NetLiquidation,BuyingPower,..."`. |

---

#### `cancel_account_summary`

Cancel account summary.

```python
def cancel_account_summary(req_id)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `req_id` | `int` | Request identifier. Used to match responses to requests. |

---

#### `req_positions`

Request all positions.  Before a session exists this is reported on the error callback and the call returns, as every other request made before connecting is. A program written against the reference client has no exception handling around a request, because that client does not raise there.

```python
def req_positions()
```

---

#### `cancel_positions`

Cancel positions.

```python
def cancel_positions()
```

---

#### `req_account_updates`

Request account updates.  `acct_code` is taken and not applied. One session holds one account here, and the venue states its figures for that account without being asked which, so there is no second account or model portfolio to name.  Subscribing also asks the venue to state the figures now. It restates them on its own schedule otherwise, which is unhurried: a session that has just opened waits tens of seconds for its first set, and a caller that subscribed and then read the account got nothing.

```python
def req_account_updates(subscribe, _acct_code="")
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `subscribe` | `bool` | `true` to start updates, `false` to stop. |
| `acct_code` | `str` | Account code (e.g. `"DU1234567"`). |

---

#### `req_managed_accts`

Request managed accounts list. Answered with every account this login holds, comma separated, matching the reference client.  Before a session exists there are no accounts to name, and an empty list reads as a login holding none rather than as a question asked too early.

```python
def req_managed_accts()
```

---

#### `req_account_updates_multi`

Request account updates for multiple accounts/models.  `ledger_and_nlv` is taken and not applied. The account figures arrive as the venue states them, and it states the ledger and the net liquidation among them without being asked.

```python
def req_account_updates_multi(req_id, account, model_code, ledger_and_nlv=False)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `req_id` | `int` | Request identifier. Used to match responses to requests. |
| `account` | `str` | Account ID. |
| `model_code` | `str` | Model portfolio code (empty for default). |
| `ledger_and_nlv` | `bool` | If `true`, include ledger and NLV data. |

---

#### `cancel_account_updates_multi`

Cancel multi-account updates.  `req_id` reaches nothing, because there is nothing to withdraw: account values arrive with the session rather than by subscription.

```python
def cancel_account_updates_multi(req_id)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `req_id` | `int` | Request identifier. Used to match responses to requests. |

---

#### `req_positions_multi`

Request positions across multiple accounts/models.

```python
def req_positions_multi(req_id, account, model_code)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `req_id` | `int` | Request identifier. Used to match responses to requests. |
| `account` | `str` | Account ID. |
| `model_code` | `str` | Model portfolio code (empty for default). |

---

#### `cancel_positions_multi`

Cancel multi-account positions. 

```python
def cancel_positions_multi(req_id)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `req_id` | `int` | Request identifier. Used to match responses to requests. |

---

#### `account_snapshot`

Read account state snapshot. Returns a dict with all account values.

```python
def account_snapshot()
```

---

## Orders

#### `place_order`

Place an order.  A request the client will not send is reported under the number the reference client reports it under, and the call returns. A program moved from that client has an `error` handler and no exception handling around a request, because nothing it was written against raises there.

```python
def place_order(order_id, contract, order)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `order_id` | `int` | Order identifier. Must be unique per session. |
| `contract` | `Contract` | Contract specification (symbol, secType, exchange, currency, etc.). |
| `order` | `Order` | Order parameters (action, quantity, type, price, TIF, etc.). |

---

#### `exercise_options`

Exercise or lapse a long option position.

```python
def exercise_options(req_id, contract, exercise_action, exercise_quantity, account, _override, manual_order_time, customer_account, professional_customer)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `req_id` | `int` | Request identifier. Used to match responses to requests. |
| `contract` | `Contract` | Contract specification (symbol, secType, exchange, currency, etc.). |
| `exercise_action` | `int` | 1=exercise, 2=lapse. |
| `exercise_quantity` | `int` | Number of contracts to exercise. |
| `account` | `str` | Account ID. |
| `override` | `int` | Override flag for exercise. |
| `manual_order_time` | `str` |  |
| `customer_account` | `str` |  |
| `professional_customer` | `bool` |  |

---

#### `cancel_order`

Cancel an order.  The second argument is what the reference client states about the withdrawal itself — when a person entered it, on whose authority, and whether a person entered it at all. It is taken as that object or as the time alone, which is how this client took it before.  A cancel on this wire names five fields and none of those is among them, so a withdrawal that states one is refused rather than sent without it: taken and dropped, the order was withdrawn under nobody's name while the caller had given one.

```python
def cancel_order(order_id, order_cancel=None)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `order_id` | `int` | Order identifier. Must be unique per session. |
| `order_cancel` | `Py<PyAny> or None` |  |

---

#### `cancel_order_by_perm_id`

Cancel an order identified by `permId` — stable across sessions, unlike the local order id. The cancel frame is orderId-only, so the local id is looked up from the open-order cache; fails if `perm_id` is not tracked.

```python
def cancel_order_by_perm_id(perm_id)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `perm_id` | `int` | Permanent order ID assigned by the server. |

---

#### `req_global_cancel`

Cancel all orders globally.

```python
def req_global_cancel(order_cancel=None)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `order_cancel` | `Py<PyAny> or None` |  |

---

#### `req_ids`

Request next valid order ID.  `num_ids` is taken and not applied. Ids are handed out one at a time here, as the reference client does whatever number is asked for.  Before a session exists there is no counter to answer from: the id an account may next use is the venue's to state. Answering announces zero, which names no order the venue will hold and is refused on placement. Reported the way the reference client reports every request made before connecting.

```python
def req_ids(num_ids=1)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `num_ids` | `int` | Number of IDs to reserve (unused). |

---

#### `next_order_id`

Get the next order ID (local counter, auto-increments).

```python
def next_order_id()
```

---

#### `next_shared_id`

The first id past everything the account has used that a request can also carry.  A caller that numbers its orders and its requests out of one counter — which is how the client this one stands in for is written — needs both at once: clear of every id an order has spent, and inside the four billion a request is carried in. An account that has been given a wider order id than that has no such number above it, so this answers with the widest the account has used that a request can carry, and the counting goes on from there.

```python
def next_shared_id()
```

---

#### `req_open_orders`

Request all open orders for this client.

```python
def req_open_orders()
```

---

#### `req_all_open_orders`

Request all open orders across all clients.  The same answer as `req_open_orders`. The reference client splits the two by client id; this wire carries no client id on an order, so the venue names the orders on the account without stating who entered them. A subset would be an attribution the venue does not supply.

```python
def req_all_open_orders()
```

---

#### `req_auto_open_orders`

Binding an order placed elsewhere to this session.  The reference client asks a local process to hand over orders a person entered by hand in front of it. There is no such process here and no such person, so there is nothing to hand over, and this reports that rather than returning as though the binding were in place.  Reported rather than returning silently: a caller told nothing waits for orders that will not arrive.  `order_bound` is never fired here: the permanent id an order was given arrives on its status and its fills, and the reference client no longer gates anything on the message that would carry it.  `b_auto_bind` is taken and not applied. Whether it asks to bind or to stop binding, the answer is the same: this session hears about every order on the account either way.

```python
def req_auto_open_orders(b_auto_bind)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `b_auto_bind` | `bool` | If `true`, auto-bind future orders to this client. |

---

#### `req_executions`

Request execution reports.  Before a session exists this is reported on the error callback, as every other request made before connecting is. Answered instead, the answer waits for a dispatch pass no session is there to make, and the caller hears nothing at all.  `lastNDays` and `specificDates` on the filter are refused when stated: the executions answered are this session's, filtered by the other fields, and a window this client cannot apply would go unapplied.

```python
def req_executions(req_id, exec_filter=None)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `req_id` | `int` | Request identifier. Used to match responses to requests. |
| `exec_filter` | `Py<PyAny> or None` |  |

---

#### `req_completed_orders`

Request completed orders.  `api_only` is taken and not applied. It asks for orders entered through an API rather than by hand, and nothing this client holds says which an order was: the completed orders are the ones this session saw, and the venue states no origin on them. Passing `true` is answered with all of them rather than with a guess at which were typed.

```python
def req_completed_orders(api_only=False)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `api_only` | `bool` |  |

---

## Market Data

#### `set_news_providers`

Set news provider codes for per-contract news ticks (e.g. "BRFG*BRFUPDN").

```python
def set_news_providers(providers)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `providers` | `str` | News provider list. |

---

#### `req_mkt_data`

```python
def req_mkt_data(req_id, contract, generic_tick_list, snapshot, regulatory_snapshot, mkt_data_options)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `req_id` | `int` | Request identifier. Used to match responses to requests. |
| `contract` | `Contract` | Contract specification (symbol, secType, exchange, currency, etc.). |
| `generic_tick_list` | `str` | Comma-separated generic tick IDs (e.g. `"233"` for RT volume). |
| `snapshot` | `bool` | If `true`, delivers one quote then auto-cancels. |
| `regulatory_snapshot` | `bool` | If `true`, request a regulatory snapshot (additional fees may apply). |
| `mkt_data_options` | `list` |  |

---

#### `req_mkt_data_ex`

Like `req_mkt_data`, but names the market-data mode on the request itself (0=realtime, 1=delayed, 2=frozen, 3=delayed-frozen) rather than taking the one the session is set to. The frozen one keeps thinly-traded names quoting after hours, when the realtime feed is silent.  A contract holds one subscription at a time, so this states the mode for that subscription rather than adding a second alongside it: a later request for a contract already subscribed follows the one that is up and is handed its quotes. To compare two modes on one contract, withdraw between them.  `regulatory_snapshot` asks for the venue's own chargeable one-shot snapshot: a request type of its own rather than a mode on an ordinary quote. It needs the entitlement, and an account without it is refused by the venue, which names the request type back through `error`. It ends the way an ordinary snapshot does, so `tickSnapshotEnd` fires either way.

```python
def req_mkt_data_ex(req_id, contract, generic_tick_list="", snapshot=False, regulatory_snapshot=False, mode_9887=0)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `req_id` | `int` | Request identifier. Used to match responses to requests. |
| `contract` | `Contract` | Contract specification (symbol, secType, exchange, currency, etc.). |
| `generic_tick_list` | `str` | Comma-separated generic tick IDs (e.g. `"233"` for RT volume). |
| `snapshot` | `bool` | If `true`, delivers one quote then auto-cancels. |
| `regulatory_snapshot` | `bool` | If `true`, request a regulatory snapshot (additional fees may apply). |
| `mode_9887` | `int` |  |

---

#### `cancel_mkt_data`

Cancel market data subscription.

```python
def cancel_mkt_data(req_id)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `req_id` | `int` | Request identifier. Used to match responses to requests. |

---

#### `req_tick_by_tick_data`

Request tick-by-tick data.  `ignore_size` is refused rather than dropped. The query the venue answers carries a filter and the filter carries this term, so the protocol is not the reason — what is not settled is how to make the venue apply it: asked for two ways, the stream came back with the size-only changes still in it. Taken and sent regardless, a caller would be told the changes were filtered and be reading a stream that was not.  `number_of_ticks` is refused rather than dropped. The query states no count of past ticks anywhere, so a caller that asked for a prelude and was answered anyway would be reading a stream that began where it was asked for rather than where they wanted. Ask for those with `reqHistoricalTicks`. Its default is none, so an ordinary call is unaffected.

```python
def req_tick_by_tick_data(req_id, contract, tick_type, number_of_ticks=0, ignore_size=False)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `req_id` | `int` | Request identifier. Used to match responses to requests. |
| `contract` | `Contract` | Contract specification (symbol, secType, exchange, currency, etc.). |
| `tick_type` | `str` | Tick type ID or tick-by-tick type string. |
| `number_of_ticks` | `int` | Maximum number of ticks to return. |
| `ignore_size` | `bool` | If `true`, ignore size in tick-by-tick data. |

---

#### `cancel_tick_by_tick_data`

Cancel tick-by-tick data.

```python
def cancel_tick_by_tick_data(req_id)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `req_id` | `int` | Request identifier. Used to match responses to requests. |

---

#### `req_ping`

Request an auth-connection round-trip time sample: sends a lightweight liveness probe with no side effects on subscriptions, contract caches, or pacing budgets. Poll `last_rtt_ms()` after a moment for the result.

```python
def req_ping()
```

---

#### `last_rtt_ms`

Last measured auth-connection round-trip time in milliseconds, or None if never measured. A gauge, not a benchmark `req_ping`. Also sampled automatically by the engine's own liveness probes.

```python
def last_rtt_ms()
```

---

#### `req_market_data_type`

Name the kind of data every subscription after this one asks for: 1 live, 2 frozen, 3 delayed, 4 delayed-frozen.  The type is carried on each subscription that follows, and the `market_data_type` callback reports the type that subscription was made under. A type this client does not know is logged and leaves subscriptions live. `req_mkt_data_ex` states the type per request, which allows two feeds on one contract at once.

```python
def req_market_data_type(market_data_type)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `market_data_type` | `int` | 1=live, 2=frozen, 3=delayed, 4=delayed-frozen. |

---

#### `req_mkt_depth`

Request market depth (L2 order book).  `mkt_depth_options` is taken and not applied. This protocol's request carries no free-form option list, so what a caller puts in one cannot be sent. The reference client's own list is empty on every ordinary call.

```python
def req_mkt_depth(req_id, contract, num_rows=5, is_smart_depth=False, mkt_depth_options=[])
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `req_id` | `int` | Request identifier. Used to match responses to requests. |
| `contract` | `Contract` | Contract specification (symbol, secType, exchange, currency, etc.). |
| `num_rows` | `int` | Number of order book rows to subscribe to. |
| `is_smart_depth` | `bool` | If `true`, aggregate depth from multiple exchanges via SMART. |
| `mkt_depth_options` | `list` |  |

---

#### `cancel_mkt_depth`

Cancel market depth.  `is_smart_depth` is taken and not applied. A book is withdrawn by the request that asked for it, and this client remembers which kind that was, so the caller restating it changes nothing.

```python
def cancel_mkt_depth(req_id, is_smart_depth=False)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `req_id` | `int` | Request identifier. Used to match responses to requests. |
| `is_smart_depth` | `bool` | If `true`, aggregate depth from multiple exchanges via SMART. |

---

#### `req_real_time_bars`

Request real-time 5-second bars.  `bar_size` and `real_time_bars_options` are taken and not applied. The venue's real-time bar is five seconds and there is no field asking for another, and this protocol's request carries no free-form option list.

```python
def req_real_time_bars(req_id, contract, bar_size=5, what_to_show="TRADES", use_rth=0, real_time_bars_options=[])
```

| `contract` | `Contract` | Contract specification (symbol, secType, exchange, currency, etc.). |
| `option_price` | `float` | Option market price. |
| `under_price` | `float` | Underlying asset price. |
| `implied_vol_options` | `list` |  |

---

#### `calculate_option_price`

What an option is worth at a stated volatility, under the same model. Answered on `tick_option_computation`.  `opt_prc_options` is taken and not applied. This protocol's request carries no free-form option list, so what a caller puts in one cannot be sent. The reference client's own list is empty on every ordinary call.

```python
def calculate_option_price(req_id, contract, volatility, under_price, opt_prc_options=[])
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `req_id` | `int` | Request identifier. Used to match responses to requests. |
| `contract` | `Contract` | Contract specification (symbol, secType, exchange, currency, etc.). |
| `volatility` | `float` | Implied volatility. |
| `under_price` | `float` | Underlying asset price. |
| `opt_prc_options` | `list` |  |

---

#### `cancel_calculate_implied_volatility`

Stop waiting on an implied-volatility request.  A question answered in the call it was asked in leaves nothing to withdraw. One that opened a watch is holding a subscription the caller never asked for by name, and this is what releases it.

```python
def cancel_calculate_implied_volatility(req_id)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `req_id` | `int` | Request identifier. Used to match responses to requests. |

---

#### `cancel_calculate_option_price`

As for `cancel_calculate_implied_volatility`.

```python
def cancel_calculate_option_price(req_id)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `req_id` | `int` | Request identifier. Used to match responses to requests. |

---

#### `req_news_bulletins`

Ask for the notices the venue broadcasts to everyone. Answered on `update_news_bulletin`.  `all_msgs` is taken and not applied, and already honoured for everything it can be. Nothing is sent to the venue: it broadcasts these unasked and this only decides whether they are delivered, so every bulletin the session has seen — including those from before this call — is handed over here. What cannot be had is anything from before the session existed, because there is no request to ask for it with. The last `NEWS_BULLETIN_LIMIT` are kept for a caller who has not asked yet.

```python
def req_news_bulletins(all_msgs=True)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `all_msgs` | `bool` | If `true`, receive all existing bulletins on subscribe. |

---

#### `cancel_news_bulletins`

Stop receiving broadcast notices.

```python
def cancel_news_bulletins()
```

---

#### `req_current_time`

Ask the venue for its own clock. Answered on `current_time`.  Before a session exists there is no venue clock to report, so this is answered the way the reference client answers every request made before connecting: on `error`, under the number it reports that by. The local clock is not a substitute, since the caller asks this to measure the difference between the two.

```python
def req_current_time()
```

---

#### `req_current_time_in_millis`

Ask the venue for its own clock in milliseconds. Answered on `current_time_in_millis`.  The same clock `req_current_time` reports and read the same way. What differs is the precision kept: the venue sometimes stamps a fraction of a second, and asking in seconds throws it away. A stamp with no fraction lands on a whole second, which is the precision the venue stated rather than a rounding of something finer.  Before a session exists this is reported on `error`, as `req_current_time` is: an answer waits for a dispatch pass, and with no session there is nothing to make one. Before anything has been stamped there is nothing to report but this machine's clock, and the log says so.

```python
def req_current_time_in_millis()
```

---

#### `request_fa`

Ask the venue for a partition of the advisor's own configuration.  The reference client names the partition by a number: its groups, its allocation profiles, its aliases. The venue names it by a word, so the number is turned into the word it stands for. A number that stands for nothing is refused rather than sent as an empty partition.  The request reaches the venue; its answer is not read back yet, so `receive_fa` does not fire. What the venue replies with lands among the messages this client records as unread. Reading it needs an advisor account to state the reply's shape, and inventing one would be a guess about a frame nobody here has seen. Said here because a caller waiting on a callback that cannot come has nothing else to tell them.

```python
def request_fa(fa_data_type)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `fa_data_type` | `int` | FA data type (1=Groups, 2=Profiles, 3=Aliases). |

---

#### `replace_fa`

Replace a partition of the advisor's configuration with the one given.  As with `request_fa`, the replacement reaches the venue and its answer is not read back, so `replace_fa_end` does not fire.  `req_id` is taken and not applied. The exchange carries no request number on this wire, and the reference client numbers it only to match the answer that is not read back here.

```python
def replace_fa(req_id, fa_data_type, cxml)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `req_id` | `int` | Request identifier. Used to match responses to requests. |
| `fa_data_type` | `int` | FA data type (1=Groups, 2=Profiles, 3=Aliases). |
| `cxml` | `str` | FA XML configuration data. |

---

#### `query_display_groups`

Ask which display groups exist. Answered on `display_group_list`.

```python
def query_display_groups(req_id)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `req_id` | `int` | Request identifier. Used to match responses to requests. |

---

#### `subscribe_to_group_events`

Watch what a display group is showing. Answered on `display_group_updated`.

```python
def subscribe_to_group_events(req_id, group_id)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `req_id` | `int` | Request identifier. Used to match responses to requests. |
| `group_id` | `int` | Display group ID. |

---

#### `unsubscribe_from_group_events`

Stop watching a display group.

```python
def unsubscribe_from_group_events(req_id)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `req_id` | `int` | Request identifier. Used to match responses to requests. |

---

#### `update_display_group`

Tell a display group what to show.

```python
def update_display_group(req_id, contract_info)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `req_id` | `int` | Request identifier. Used to match responses to requests. |
| `contract_info` | `str` | Display group contract info string. |

---

#### `req_smart_components`

Ask which venue each bit of a quote's exchange mask refers to. The venue states the map beside the quote, so a quote has to have been asked for first. Answered on `smart_components`.  `bbo_exchange` is taken and not applied. The venue states one table of routing components at logon, for this session rather than per exchange, and that whole table is what comes back.

```python
def req_smart_components(req_id, bbo_exchange)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `req_id` | `int` | Request identifier. Used to match responses to requests. |
| `bbo_exchange` | `str` | BBO exchange for smart component lookup (e.g. `"SMART"`). |

---

#### `req_news_providers`

Ask which news providers this account may read. Answered on `news_providers`.

---

#### `req_soft_dollar_tiers`

Ask which soft dollar tiers this account may direct commission to. Answered on `soft_dollar_tiers`.

```python
def req_soft_dollar_tiers(req_id)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `req_id` | `int` | Request identifier. Used to match responses to requests. |

---

#### `req_family_codes`

Ask which account families this login belongs to. Answered on `family_codes`.

```python
def req_family_codes()
```

---

#### `set_server_log_level`

How much to log about this session, 1 to 5.  Recorded locally rather than sent: this wire carries no log-level request. A level outside 1 to 5 is refused rather than reported back as `warn`, which would tell a caller they had a level that does not exist.

```python
def set_server_log_level(log_level=2)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `log_level` | `int` | Log level: 1=error, 2=warn, 3=info, 4=debug, 5=trace. |

---

#### `req_user_info`

Ask what this login is entitled to. Answered on `user_info`.

```python
def req_user_info(req_id)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `req_id` | `int` | Request identifier. Used to match responses to requests. |

---

#### `req_wsh_meta_data`

What event types the corporate-events calendar carries. Answered on `wshMetaData`.

```python
def req_wsh_meta_data(req_id)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `req_id` | `int` | Request identifier. Used to match responses to requests. |

---

#### `cancel_wsh_meta_data`

Stop waiting on the event types.  The query is one message and one answer, so there is nothing at the venue to withdraw: what is withdrawn is the answer, which would otherwise reach a caller who has said they are done with it. A cancel naming no waiting request says so rather than returning as though it acted.

```python
def cancel_wsh_meta_data(req_id)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `req_id` | `int` | Request identifier. Used to match responses to requests. |

---

#### `cancel_wsh_event_data`

Stop waiting on the calendar's events. As above.

```python
def cancel_wsh_event_data(req_id)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `req_id` | `int` | Request identifier. Used to match responses to requests. |

---

#### `req_wsh_event_data`

The calendar's events. Answered on `wshEventData`.  `wsh_event_data` is the object the public API takes: a contract id, or a filter the caller writes, plus the window and what to fill from.

```python
def req_wsh_event_data(req_id, wsh_event_data=None)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `req_id` | `int` | Request identifier. Used to match responses to requests. |
| `wsh_event_data` | `Py<PyAny> or None` |  |

---

## EWrapper Callbacks

#### `new`

Create a new EClient (or EWrapper) instance.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `args` | `Bound<'_, pyo3::types::PyTuple>` |  |
| `kwargs` | `Bound<'_, pyo3::types::PyDict> or None` |  |

---

#### `connect_ack`

The session is open. Nothing has been asked for yet.

---

#### `connection_closed`

The session is over, because this client ended it. A session that went away instead is reported on `error` under 1100.

---

#### `next_valid_id`

The first order id this session may use. Each order needs one higher than the last.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `order_id` | `int` | Order identifier. Must be unique per session. |

---

#### `managed_accounts`

Every account this login may act for, separated by commas. One for most logins; an advisor has several.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `accounts_list` | `str` | Comma-separated account IDs. |

---

#### `error`

What the venue said about a request, under the number it says it with. Codes from 2100 to 2200 are notices about a connection rather than failures. `req_id` is -1 for anything that answers no particular request.  A request this client will not send is reported here too, under the same numbers the reference client uses: 321 for a request that fails validation, 200 for a contract description that matches nothing, 504 for a call made with no session.  `error_time` is the reference client's second parameter and is stated wherever it states one. It carries a clock reading in milliseconds for trouble this client raises before anything reached the venue, and zero for trouble the venue stated — which is what that client passes for a session speaking a protocol older than the one that added the field, and this one says it speaks an older protocol than that.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `req_id` | `int` | Request identifier. Used to match responses to requests. |
| `error_time` | `int` |  |
| `error_code` | `int` | Error code. |

The venue clock, in seconds since the epoch.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `time` | `int` | Tick timestamp (Unix seconds). |

---

#### `current_time_in_millis`

The venue clock, in milliseconds since the epoch.  The same clock `current_time` reports, at the precision the venue stated it in. The stamp can carry a fraction of a second and this reads it where it does, but the stamps measured against this venue carried none, so the answer lands on a whole second.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `time_in_millis` | `int` |  |

---

#### `tick_price`

One price of a quote, and which price it is. `tick_type` names it — 1 bid, 2 ask, 4 last, 9 close — and `attrib` says whether it can be traded against and whether it is past its limit. A size arrives on `tick_size` under the type that belongs to it.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `req_id` | `int` | Request identifier. Used to match responses to requests. |

| `tick_type` | `int` | Tick type ID or tick-by-tick type string. |
| `value` | `str` | Account value. |

---

#### `tick_generic`

A quote's value that is a number and is not a price or a size — an implied volatility, an index future's premium, a halt.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `req_id` | `int` | Request identifier. Used to match responses to requests. |
| `tick_type` | `int` | Tick type ID or tick-by-tick type string. |
| `value` | `float` | Account value. |

---

#### `tick_snapshot_end`

| `mkt_cap_price` | `float` | Market cap price for the order. |

---

#### `open_order`

An order as the venue holds it, and the state it is in. Fires beside every `order_status`, when open orders are asked for, and once for a preview — where the state carries what the order would cost and no status follows, because a preview is not an order.

| `commission_and_fees_report` | `Py<PyAny>` |  |

---

#### `update_account_value`

One figure the venue states about an account, in the currency it states it in. An account is stated in several currencies at once, so the same key arrives more than once.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
