"""A bracket child must report the parent it was placed with.

The engine reads no parent from an execution report, so for an order this
client placed its own record is the only source. The Rust client prefers that
record on all three callback paths; these cover the two the Python client also
has, which its own tests did not reach.

Reverting either Python lookup leaves every Rust test passing, which is how
the gap was found.
