"""Cancel-reject reconciliation.

Regression: when the venue rejects a cancel for an order it had previously
listed in the post-connect mass-status burst (CxlRejReason=1, "No such
order"), IBX must:

  - parse OrigClOrdID (tag 41) correctly despite the venue's "C" prefix
    and ".0/.1/.2" modify-chain suffix,
  - surface the reject through wrapper.error (code 202),
  - purge the stale entry from order_cache so subsequent req_open_orders
    stops returning it.

Pre-fix: tag 41 was parsed without the prefix/suffix strip → orig_clord
was None → no reject pushed → silent. order_cache was untouched, so
req_open_orders kept returning the stale entry forever.
