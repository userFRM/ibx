"""Count what reaches the venue, as opposed to what merely exists.

A call that exists, carries the right name and the right arguments, and returns
without error is not thereby a call that did anything. Counting the surface says
a program written elsewhere compiles here; it does not say the request left the
machine. The two are different claims and only one of them is worth making.

Every caller-facing request falls into one of five kinds:

  wire      it sends a command to the engine, which puts it on the venue's wire
  session   it answers from what the venue has already pushed to this session
  refused   it reports that this client cannot serve it, and says why
  missing   it should reach the venue and does not
  withdrawn it withdraws something that was never running here, and says so
  silent    it returns as though it did something and did not

`silent` must stay at zero. The others are facts to be stated, not failures:
the venue pushes account and position data on login, and these calls answer
from that push.

Writes target/gates/wire-reach.md, which is a report and not the gate: this
exits non-zero on its own findings, and on a total the capability matrix
publishes that no longer matches. The number cannot
drift away from the code.
