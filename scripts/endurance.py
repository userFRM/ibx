"""Hold a session open under load, and fail if anything stops arriving.

What only a session finds: a connection that stops answering, a stream that
stops arriving, a request id that answers once. None of it is reachable by a
suite that opens a session, asks one question and closes it — every defect
this has found was invisible to the offline gates and to the live suites
alike.

Subscriptions are taken out and withdrawn every cycle, under request ids that
repeat, because that is what a program does and it is where the defects were.
Quotes and bars are required to have grown by the end of every cycle after the
first, and a book and a trade stream to have arrived at least once before the
run ends: a stream that stalls is the failure, and a run that only printed its
counters would have passed through all of them.

Places no orders. Reads only.
