"""Finding a module whichever file it lives in.

A module is `x.rs` until it grows a folder, and then it is `x/mod.rs`. A
generator that names one form stops reading the day it moves — and one that
reads nothing reports everything it was watching as absent, which is worse
than failing. Both `gen_wire_coverage` and `gen_order_field_reach` were caught
by this the day the engine's files were split.
