"""Run an unmodified `ib_async` program without a gateway.

`ib_async` is layered: `IB`, `Wrapper`, `Ticker`, `Trade` and everything above
them are transport-agnostic, and only its `Client`/`Connection` know there is a
socket to a gateway on localhost. This replaces that one layer with this
engine. Everything above it — the events, the async variants, the notebooks —
runs unchanged, from the copy of `ib_async` already installed.

No part of `ib_async` is copied or modified: install it as usual, and attach.

`IB.connect` takes a host, a port and a client id because it was written for a
