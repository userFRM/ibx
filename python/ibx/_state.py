"""What the session currently holds, kept current as it runs.

The wrapper this follows hands a caller live objects: ``ib.positions()`` is what
the account holds right now, and ``ib.trades()`` are orders whose status changes
under the caller as fills arrive. That is a different thing from a request that
answers once, and it is the part a program written against that wrapper leans on
most.

It works by keeping a pump running. The pump owns dispatch, and dispatch fires
the callbacks below, which record rather than act. A caller reading a list gets
a snapshot copied under a lock, so the list cannot change while it is being
read — a half-updated list is worse than a slightly old one.
